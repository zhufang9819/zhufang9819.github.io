In this post, we test various features of the Minimal Mistakes template and Jekyll. <!--more-->First, we evaluate the header levels in Markdown. Then, we assess the performance of MathJax when embedded into Jekyll.In the post, we test some functions of the minimal mistakes template and jekyll.

## Math Formula
We first test the inline formulas, $a, \bm{a}, \mathbf{a}, \mathrm{a}$, $\mathcal{A}, \mathbb{R}, \mathscr{A}, \mathbf{A}$ and $\int, \iint, \oint$. Next, we test the mathematical blocks by presenting the Divergence Theorem:

$$
\int_D \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, d x = \int_{\partial D} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, d x.
$$

Here, $D$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\partial D$ is the piecewise smooth surface of $D$, $\mathbf{F}$ is a continuously differentiable vector field, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal vector at points on $\partial D$.
